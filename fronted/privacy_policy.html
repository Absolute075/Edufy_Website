                We process this data under one or more legal bases including: contract performance (when providing services you requested), legitimate interests (for platform improvement and security), legal obligations, and in some cases your explicit consent (for marketing communications or sensitive data processing).
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4 text-white">Data Security</h2>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
                We employ state-of-the-art security measures to protect your data:
            </p>
            <ul class="text-gray-300 mb-6 space-y-2 list-disc pl-5">
                <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> All data is encrypted both in transit (using TLS 1.2+ protocols) and at rest (AES-256 encryption for stored data)</li>
                <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Strict role-based access policies with multi-factor authentication for all staff, regular access reviews, and principle of least privilege enforcement</li>
                <li><strong>Infrastructure Security:</strong> Hosted on ISO 27001 certified cloud providers with regular vulnerability scanning, intrusion detection systems, and DDoS protection</li>
                <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> We only collect data necessary for specified purposes and retain it only as long as needed (maximum 5 years unless legally required otherwise)</li>
                <li><strong>Security Testing:</strong> Regular penetration testing by independent security firms, bug bounty program, and continuous monitoring for vulnerabilities</li>
                <li><strong>Incident Response:</strong> Documented breach notification procedures that comply with GDPR and other regulations, with 72-hour notification window for significant breaches</li>
                <li><strong>Employee Training:</strong> Mandatory privacy and security training for all staff with annual refreshers and role-specific additional training</li>
                <li><strong>Physical Security:</strong> Data centers with biometric access controls, 24/7 surveillance, and environmental protections against fire/flood</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
                While we implement these robust measures, no system is 100% secure. We recommend you use strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and be cautious about sharing account credentials. In the unlikely event of a data breach, we will notify affected users promptly in accordance with applicable laws.
            </p>
